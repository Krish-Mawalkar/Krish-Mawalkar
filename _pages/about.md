I am a third-year Statistics and Machine Learning student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am completing minors in Business Analytics & Optimization, Philosophy. I have past work experience as a Summer Analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, where I supported the Quantitative Analytics/Focused Analytics Solutions Team and the Machine Learning & Intelligence Operations (MLIO) Group. I am working as a Summer Data Scientist at the Federal Reserve - Bank of St. Louis (Banking Supervision Division).

I am a former junior U.S. National Karate Champion and enjoy practicing karate and lifting. I also play the Cello and enjoy spending time with my family, especially my dog, Roscoe (@roscoe_says_hi on Instagram).
